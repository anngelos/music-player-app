# Music Player App

Project carried out in the course "Complete Vue Developer 2023: Zero to Mastery (Pinia, Vitest)" on the Udemy platform, instructed by Andrei Neagoie and Luis Ramirez Jr. The project is a music player that resembles a social network. In it, the user can register and log in to the platform, post comments, and even upload their own songs, which will be stored in the Google database, Firebase. These songs can be listened to at any time and from any device.
In this course, I learned both the fundamentals of Vue.js and more advanced concepts. I also learned about unit testing and got introduced to a new state management system, Pinia.
